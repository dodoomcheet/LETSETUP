selenium method makes setted browsers work too slow.
must import other packages that make it possible to control mouse and keyboard
and LETSETUP must be able to scan monitor and set up browsers and programs (ex. page login)
TO DO THAT, must develop artificial intelligence
its same day night time. I write devlog first time....
i hope this be helpful to my future developer career
alright
i got some KEYS..
first key. python's basic libraries can be super helpful.
LETSETUP needs to be imported "mouse" and "keyboard".
they are super simple and super usable..
second key is the keyword,"VISION AI"
it is do same work as its name.
my target can be finding appropriate usable "vision AI" or....... make one!
while writing down..
the github interface reminds me that COLOR is the best to take your sight to it's place.
that one right upside, the green button on white background is very very eyecatching.
im not professional on designing web page yet.
so i write memo here..
### COLOR IS THE BEST EYECHATING ELEMENT! ###
AI MN/ML API.. is it free?
by chat gpt. it is free for certain duration but eventually it costs money.
okay...
now my target is to make VISION AI thing.
